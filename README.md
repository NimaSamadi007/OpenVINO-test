# OpenVINO Framework
In this repository I will test and document the OpenVINO Framework. According to [OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/index.html):
> OpenVINOâ„¢ is an open-source toolkit for optimizing and deploying AI inference.

So, the purpose of OpenVINO is to enhance the performance of AI inference. It is currently support Intel hardware (also ARM CPU is supported but not officially as of now). Since Intel CPU is quite widespread and widely used, we choose it as one of the main implementation hardware.
